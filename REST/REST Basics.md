# REST Basics

## What does REST stand for?

REST is an abbreviation of REpresentational State Transfer.
What this really means is that REST is an architecture style for creating stateless communications.

## Common Implementation of a RESTful application

REST is very often implemented on top of HTTP to enable CRUDs operations on an application.

This implementation maps *C*reation operations to POST/PUT requests, *R*ead operations to GET requests, *U*updates to POST/PUT requests, and *D*eletes to DELETE request
