People create additional branches in order to find a bug or add some additional features. Listed below are the steps to
create another branch, add all the changes that you make to that branch, and then merge it with your master branch.

1. In order to create another branch called change_me, you would run this command:
	git branch change_me

2. If you wanted to switch into the new branch that you just created, you would run this command:
	git checkout change_me

3. To add all of the new files that you created to this branch, you would run this command: 
	git add .

4. You will need to commit your changes to the new branch and you would do this by running this command:
	git commit -m "added files to the new branch"

5. In order to merge the changes the you made to your new branch with your master branch, you will need to switch back into 
your master branch by running this command:
	git checkout master

6. You are almost finished. Since we are in our master branch, we are going to tell git to merge our change_me branch into it 
by running this command:
	git merge change_me

7. Once you have merged your change_me branch with your master branch, you don't need it anymore so we can go ahead and get rid 
of it by running this command:
	git branch -d change_me

8. There is one last thing that you must do and that is to push everything to your remote repository by running this command:
	git push
