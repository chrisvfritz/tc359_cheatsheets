# TC359 Cheatsheets

This whole repository is just a dumping ground for resources to help us with common tasks and difficult concepts in TC359. Anyone in the class can add to it or modify it.

If there's a topic you'd like to add to or share, just go ahead and do it. You don't need permission or anything. If there's a particular topic or kind of resource you'd like to request, list it in the TODO section below.
