#Which Text Editor Is Right For You?

Every programmer comes across this at least once in their career. Figuring out which text editor is best for the project they are working on. Eventually, they will build biases and opinions towards one particular editor over another. This page is going to try and break down some of the better known text editors.

**Note: I have do not have any IDE's listed and the information found in this document is research I've found online. See references below**

##Notepad++

Notepad++ is a very common text editor used in the Windows programming world. It is open source, free and contains a lot of the same features of its paid competing text editors, like UltraEdit and TexPad. Notepad++ is ultimately used a lot for web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML and PHP. Notepad++ has a lot of necessary features such as line numbering, syntax highlighting, detection of modified files, Compare Mode and more. Plus it's free. You can customize Notepad++ to look how you want in case you have a particular color scheme when you program. I use Notepad++ on any Windows machine that I'm working on with Web Development.

Verdict: It's lightweight, loads fast and gets the job done for Windows.

##Sublime

Sublime is the common text editor that comes cross platform. Yes it says you have to pay $70 to register your copy of Sublime but you can evaluate the editor for as long as you want. It will just keep bugging you to register which you can promptly ignore for as long as you want. One of the unique features of Sublime is the "Minimap" of your code on the right. For long files you can generally peak and find a chunk of code that you want by looking at your Mini-map. Sublime also has a lot of useful plug-ins like Package Control which allows you to search, download and install other plugins within Sublime right from the editor. Sublime also has a big community built behind it and supporting it.

Verdict: It's lightweight, has usefull features and is cross platform.

##Atom

Atom is a Text Editor created by GitHub for Mac OS X. It is very similar to Sublime with the way it looks though it has a slightly rounder look to it. It has a similar tree view like Sublime's sidebar. One of Atom's greatest features is its git integration. The tree view has color indicators for .gitignore files and changed files that have not been committed. Atom is a web based desktop application built on top of Chromium which means that it's performance takes a hit because every tab, window or frame has to be rendered locally from HTML. Atom also can't really handle any file bigger than 2Mb.

Verdict: Great git integration but is not as good as Sublime.

##Vim

Vim is a text editor available on all Unix systems. It is a lightweight, fast tool that is customizable to your needs. However, there is a very big learning curve initially with all the commands (insert, append, deleting etc). There is a lot you can do without leaving home row in Vim but only if you know the commands and what to do with them. Beginners are typically lost as I was. Once you know what your doing it's fairly powerful but the beginning deters a lot of people. It has a lot of the same features of most text editors such as syntax highlighting, brace matching etc.

Verdict: Powerful once mastered, frustratingly difficult until then.
