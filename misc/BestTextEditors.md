#Which Text Editor Is Right For You?

Every programmer comes across this at least once in their career. Figuring out which text editor is best for the project they are working on. Eventually, they will build biases and opinions towards one particular editor over another. This page is going to try and break down some of the better known text editors and see which projects they are best suited for.

##Notepad++

Notepad++ is a very common text editor used in the Windows programming world. It is open source, free and contains a lot of the same features of its paid competing text editors, like UltraEdit and TexPad. Notepad++ is ultimately used a lot for web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML and PHP. Notepad++ has a lot of necessary features such as line numbering, syntax highlighting, detection of modified files, Compare Mode and more. Plus it's free. You can customize Notepad++ to look how you want in case you have a particular color scheme when you program. I use Notepad++ on any Windows machine that I'm working on with Web Development. It's lightweight, loads fast and gets the job done.

##Sublime

Sublime is the common text editor used for Mac in the programming world. 

##Eclipse



##PhpStorm
