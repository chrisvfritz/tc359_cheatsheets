# Strings

Strings are just text. In fancy terms, you could consider them an ordered list of characters. They are typically seen as one or more characters between either single quotes (apostrophes) or double quotes. Below are some examples:

``` ruby
'a'
```

``` ruby
"a"
```

``` ruby
'1'
```

``` ruby
'This is a string.'
```

``` ruby
"I can place any kind of text in a string, including letters (e.g. a, b, c), numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3), or any other characters, no matter how special (e.g. $, %, *)."
```
