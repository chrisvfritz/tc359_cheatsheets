How to generate a basic sprite using CSS

Sprites are essentially a number of images contained into one file.  
For example a typical CSS sprite will have a few images contained in a PNG file.
Although the file size of the sprite containing all the images will be a slightly larger file size than the images by themselves,
the purpose of the sprite is that all the images are loaded with a single HTTP request!  

One can generate sprites using the following software: Grunt/Node, Compass, ImageMagick, SpriteCow.

Let's say you have a three images (called diamond, square, and circle) combined in a sprite called "shapes.png"
First, create class names for each shape image in the sprite.

.diamond, .square, .circle {
	background-image: url('../images/shapes.png');
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

Second, to display each image create a class for each image setting the correct height of each image as well as the background position.
*Note that there is a 5px margin between each image in the sprite.

.diamond {
	height: 75px;
	background-position: 0px;
}
.square {
	height: 125px;
	background-position: -80px;
}
.circle {
	height: 50px;
	background-position: -210px;
}

Now whenever you call each class in your HTML, you will have that portion of the sprite be displayed which is that single image!
