Benefits of using SASS over just plain CSS:
1. Less code to write! With SASS, you can nest your CSS statements, and then compile the code. This will automatically write out all the long statements if you couldn’t nest your code.
2. It keeps your code more organized. Things are much easier to find, especially with having significantly less code.
3. It is good for creating responsive websites. You can adjust CSS based on the viewing size (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
4. You can set color values to names, and reuse them so you don’t have to keep typing out the same hex code over and over again.
Implementation: 
You have to get software that can compile the SASS code/files, then make sure to include the code to use it in your files.
