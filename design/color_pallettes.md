# Creating Color Palettes For Websites

With the number of tools available online today, creating color palettes for websites is easier than you might think. You don't need to be a brilliant designer to make a great color palette. However, understanding some basic terminology can take you a long way.

## Color Terminology

**Hue** - The actual color something is. *Ex. Red or Green*

**Chrome** - How pure a long is (the lack of white, black, or gray present in it).

**Saturation** - How strong or weak a color is.

**Value** - How light or dark a color is.

**Tone** - The amount of gray in a pure hue.

**Shade** - Black added to a pure hue.

**Tint** - White added to a hue.

Once you understand the basic terminology, you can start to understand the various types of traditional color schemes.

## Color Schemes

**Monochromatic** - Comprised of different tones, shades, and tints within a specific color scheme.

**Analogous** - Created by using three colors that are next to each other on the 12-spoke color wheel.

**Complementary** - Created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel.

**Split Complementary** - Similar to Complementary color schemes but instead of using opposite colors, you use colors on either side of the hue opposite your base hue.

**Triadic** - Comprised of hues equally spaced around the 12-spoke color wheel.

**Custom** - No formal rules. The most difficult color schemes to create.
