In order to save  something for a user using HTML 5, you first have to make sure that thier browser is able to support it.

The following is suggested javascript code on how to detect if the browser supports local storage.
This was obtained from http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
"
function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
"

Once you have determined that the browser supports local starage, you are ready to begin.

Local storage in HTML 5 is based on the idea of having a key and a value. The key is used to locate and modify the value.

The two functions you need to use the basic storage system are "getItem()" and "setItem()".

"getItem()" is rather straightforward. It gets a file based on its key and retarns the value of that file. It takes one parameter.
(ex. "getItem(color1)" would return the value of the file with the key "color1")


"setItem()" is straightforward as well. It sets a file of a certain key to whatever you want. It takes two parameters.
(ex. "setItem(color1, "blue")" would set the file with the key "color1" to "blue")
