# Useful Web Development Frameworks

## What is a Web Development Framework?

A web development framework is used to help you create nice looking websites quicker than you might normally be able to. They generally include prewritten CSS files, with many tags already styled, so you don't have to create the styles, all you need to do is add a class tag to your html tags.
